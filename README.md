# Olympics-Trend-Analysis
This is my first Power BI Dashboard. This dashboard will help you get a comprehensive overview of the trends in Olympics.
The dataset comprises of facts and figures of the Olympic games from 1896 to 2020. Some of my key findings are as follows:

1) Michael Phelps has earned the most number of medals in the history of Olympics.

2) In 2020, though USA had the most number medals, China stood first as it had the most number of gold medals.

3) In the 1900s, men dominated the medal tally. By early 2000s the scenario changed and by 2020 both men and women have an equal share in the medals tally.

4) India has won 35 medals until 2020.
